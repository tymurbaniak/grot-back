Here is the configuration for proxy container. 
To make it work for ssl you need to generate private key and public certificate in certs directory,
those files will be copied to proxy for nginx during building docker images.

To create key and crt use;
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -subj "/C=US/ST=Denial/L=Springfield/O=Dis/CN=domain-name-on-localhost" -keyout certs/nginx-selfsigned.key -out certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt
and
openssl dhparam -out certs/dhparam.pem 2048
